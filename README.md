# ðŸ¤– Customer Support Automation with CrewAI

This project demonstrates how to automate high-quality customer support workflows using [CrewAI](https://crewai.com), `LangChain`, and OpenAI's LLMs in a structured and collaborative manner.

It includes:
- A **support representative agent** that provides comprehensive responses to customer inquiries.
- A **quality assurance agent** that reviews and improves those responses to ensure accuracy and tone.
- Integration of external tools for web search and documentation scraping.
